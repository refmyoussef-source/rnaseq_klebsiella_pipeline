    "This notebook performs the alignment step. We map our cleaned, paired-end reads (from `02_Trimmed_Data`) to the reference genome (from `06_Genome_Index`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow:**\n",
    "1.  **Build Index:** First, create a `HISAT2` index from our reference genome (`genome.fna.gz`). This is a one-time step that makes alignment fast.\n",
    "2.  **Run Alignment:** Loop through all 6 samples and run `hisat2` to align the paired-end reads.\n",
    "3.  **Convert & Sort:** Convert the output (`.sam`) to the compressed `.bam` format (which saves space) and sort it.\n",
    "4.  **Index BAM:** Create an index (`.bai`) for the sorted BAM files. This is required for visualization and counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools:** `hisat2`, `samtools` (which is part of the `subread` package we installed)"
