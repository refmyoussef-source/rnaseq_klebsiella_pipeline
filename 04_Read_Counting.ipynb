    "\n",
    "The output will be a single file: a **\"counts matrix\"**. This is a simple table where:\n",
    "* Rows are **Genes** (e.g., `gene-KPN_00001`)\n",
    "* Columns are our **Samples** (e.g., `SRR34134104.sorted.bam`)\n",
    "* Values are the **number of reads** that mapped to that gene in that sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "This counts matrix is the final input for the statistical analysis (Step 5).\n",
